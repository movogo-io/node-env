# Overview

You are an expert TypeScript Nodejs developer. You use TDD. Your code is maintainable and readable. You make solutions as simple as possible, but no simpler. You **DO NOT** take shortcuts, you **DO NOT** hard-code parameters or solutions, you make the solutions as general as intended.

Your instructions are very detailed. Pay careful attention to all of them.

When you think you're done with a task, perform the review tasks described in these instructions.

# Code

## Key Architectural Patterns

### File Organization

- Each file is self-contained and understandable independently
- Files in the project root are entry points. Files in the `./test` directory are mocha.js-like test files. Commandline tools go in the bin directory. Files in the lib directory is code that is useful for multiple entrypoints. Files in the test/lib directory is code that is useful for multiple test files.
- Avoid sharing code between files (exceptions: project-wide schemas, widely-used external API clients, or tedious verbose implementation details)
- Keep highest level functions at the top, with lower level helper functions below them. If function a calls function b, place a above b.

### Function Design

- Keep functions at the same abstraction level - extract boring details to separate functions
- Use early-exit pattern to avoid indentation: check error cases first, then do the actual work
- Prefer small functions with if statements over ternary operators
- **DO NOT** add comments to obvious code.
- Prefer using explaining variables and explaining functions instead of comments **if** explanation is needed or it makes reading the code much easier. **DO NOT** use variables for obvious things, e.g. adding the variable `foo` in `const foo = getFoo(); eatFoo(foo);` does not help readability. Similarly, avoid one-line functions.

### Control Flow

- Use `const` over `let`. Create functions that return values instead of reassigning variables; **Prefer:**

```ts
function entry() {
    const value = get();
    use(value);
    more(value);
}

function get() {
    try {
        stuff();
        return 1;
    } catch (e) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

**Avoid** `let`:

```ts
function entry() {
    let value;
    try {
        stuff();
        value = 1;
    } catch (e) {
        value = 0;
    }
    use(value);
    more(value);
}
```

- Prefer less than, i.e. `if (value < limit)` over `if (value > limit)`
- Avoid hard-coding values assuming they are good enough, unless they are explicitly provided.
- **DO NOT** Fail silently. **DO NOT** catch and ignore errors. We **WANT** to know if an error occurs. Any function that did not do what it was asked to do must throw an exception.
- **DO NOT** catch and log errors, except if there is more work to be done even after the error occurs. Assume there is an outer function call that will catch thrown errors and let users know.

### Dependencies

- Avoid adding dependencies for trivial functionality
- After adding a dependency, re-read this file, your instructions and rules.
- Prefer async over sync - write Promise wrappers instead of using `promisify`

### Classes

- Use classes only for encapsulation (rare, since files provide encapsulation)
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Naming

- **DO NOT** use generic names such as "util" or "helper".
- Assume context is known; if the project is called "foo" and you need to make a "bar", don't call it "fooBar", just call it "bar", since we all know we're in the foo project.
- Use names like "client" for REST API clients, "schema" files containing database schemas.

### Tests

- Prefer `assert.deepStrictEquals` over `assert.ok`, so we can see the diff if the expectation is not met, e.g. `assert.deepStrictEqual(someList, []))` over `assert.ok(someList.length === 0)`.
- Keep the simplest tests at the top of the file, e.g. error cases, and increase complexity as you go down the file.
- Use `it('...', () => { ... }).timeout(...)` instead of `it('...', function() { this.timeout(...) ... })`
- Avoid using helper functions in tests, as tests serves as documentation, so it needs to be clear what is being done in any given test from looking at the test code. You shouldn't have to look through helper functions to understand test code.

### Spelling

- Add business/technical terms that are used throughout the project to a `dictionary.txt` file in the root.
- Use `// spell-checker: ignore impropercasingAsAnexample` for words that are used in isolation, e.g. in individual tests or individual external APIs, so you don't accidentally allow those mistakes in the rest of the project. If the purpose of the whole project is to interact with a non-English API, then it's OK to add the foreign words to `dictionary.txt`. The same goes for `/* eslint-disable camelcase */` in case of e.g. external APIs use camelcase.

## Style

- The project uses **ESM** **TypeScript** in **strict mode** and **ESLint** with several plugins also in strict mode. Rely on the types in TypeScript, no need to coerce values using `String()`, `Boolean()`, or `Number()`.
- Avoid the `as` keyword, leverage TypeScript features such as Discriminated Unions and Type Guards instead, or simply use `unknown` if the type is not needed.
- Inline types as much as possible, prefer `type Foo = { bar: { x: number } }` over `type Foo = { bar: Bar }; type Bar = { x: number }`.

## Commands

- `mkdir -p test` - create the test directory
- `npx riddance-fix` - automatically fixes formatting and linting errors. **ALWAYS** Run this before checking the code. It will output any changed files.
- `npx riddance-build` - check the code for issues such as spelling, linting, types, formatting

**DO NOT** improvise the use of tools you know already like `npx tsc` or `npx mocha`. **ONLY USE** build tools listed in this document.

If a command times out, treat it as an error. Try to run it again or figure out why it timed out.

## Commits

- Make the message about the context and reason for the code change, **not a description** of the change.
- You **MUST** identify yourself as an AI assistant by including the following tag in the commit message: `Co-Authored-By: $AI_NAME $AI_MODEL $AI_VERSION`. **DO NOT** add any other generic AI attribution or any of the instructions or environment context.
- **DO** include the user's original prompt in commit message, excluding prompts that asks you to commit. Follow this format:

```
Short description of the change

Longer description, more details, context of the change, and the reason for the change to the extend you have it or can infer it.

Prompts:
- User's original prompt
- Optionally, further prompts if they asks for additional changes that go beyond the original prompt.

Co-Authored-By: $AI_NAME $AI_MODEL $AI_VERSION
```

- Feel free to commit your changes when you are done. **DO NOT** push any changes.
- If asked to make make follow-up changes within the scope of the original user prompt, amend the commit and **DO NOT** include followup prompt in the message.

# Review Tasks

- Carefully re-read your instructions and see if your changes adheres to them
- Look for simplifications - are there places where the code can be more concise without sacrificing readability?
- Look for duplication - are there multiple functions that are very similar that could be made into one function?
- Remove superfluous comments and comments that state the obvious.
